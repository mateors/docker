# Simple PHP Website

I put together this project while introducing a friend of mine to PHP. I decided to clean it up a bit and put it on Github so anyone new to PHP can have a taste of a very simple and minimal website built with PHP.

This project is meant for absolute beginners. I've intentionally kept it the most minimal possible while introducing some separation of concerns.

## Concepts

The project covers these concepts:

 * PHP variables
 * PHP arrays
 * PHP functions
 * Pretty links (/about) with fallback to query string (?page=about)
 * Basic example of separation of concerns (functionality, content, template)

If you are a beginner and would like me to explain something in the code, or if you already know PHP and have some recommendation for the project, plese [create an issue](https://github.com/banago/simple-php-website/issues/new) or hit me up on Twitter [@banago](https://twitter.com/banago).

## Lisence
